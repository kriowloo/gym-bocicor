# OpenAI Gym environment: gym-bocicor

This environment was created to represent the RL tasks related to genome assembly presented in the manuscript entitled [A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving the Fragment Assembly Problem](https://doi.org/10.1109/SYNASC.2011.9). According to OpenAI Gym instructions, use PIP to install it (after installing [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)). You can do it directly using the Github repository address, as follows:

```sh
pip install -e git+https://github.com/kriowloo/gym-bocicor.git#egg=gym-bocicor
```

There are two versions that can be used after installing *gym-bocicor*, namely *gym_bocicor:bocicor-v1* and *gym_bocicor:bocicor-v2*. The first one corresponds to the task addressed by the first experiment of the aforementioned manuscript; while the last one corresponds to the second experiment.
